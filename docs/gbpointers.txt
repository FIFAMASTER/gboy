Gameboy Pointer Hacking
Written by Coolboyman

Gameboy Pointers are really easy to hack. All the answers you need are in
this doc!

Tools Needed:
Emulator (duh)
Gameboy Rom (duh)
Hex editor
A brain to understand this simple concept.

NOTE: If you are a newbie and just starting ROM hacking, I recommend you
do the pointers later, because this could get confusing if you just started out.
IF you feel you can actually pull this off, read ahead…

Ok so lets say your editing some text, that starts at the location 1AF239. You
start changing the text, and realize something: You ran out of room of the text
you want. The answer is to re-point the text to a blank location in the ROM.
There are 2 kinds of pointers in a Gameboy:

3 byte pointers: These pointers can point anywhere in the ROM. Now lets say
you want to re-point 1FF017. The first byte is the bank location. For example
0-3FFF is one bank, 4000-7FFF is another bank. Don’t understand? Well
this is how it is:
00 = 0000-3FFF
01 = 4000-7FFF
02 = 8000-BFFF
03 = C000-FFFF
04 = 10000-13FFF
05 = 14000-17FFF
06 = 18000-1BFFF
07 = 1C000-1FFFF
08 = 20000-23FFF
09 = 24000-27FFF
0A = 28000-2BFFF
0B = 2C000-2FFFF
0C = 30000-33FFF
0D = 34000-37FFF
0E = 38000-3BFFF
0F = 3C000-3FFFF
10 = 40000-43FFF
11 = 44000-47FFF
12 = 48000-4BFFF
13 = 4C000-4FFFF
14 = 50000-53FFF
15 = 54000-57FFF
16 = 58000-5BFFF
17 = 5C000-5FFFF
18 = 60000-63FFF
19 = 64000-67FFF
1A = 68000-6BFFF
1B = 6C000-6FFFF
1C = 70000-73FFF
1D = 74000-77FFF
1E = 78000-7BFFF
1F = 7C000-7FFFF
20 = 80000-83FFF
21 = 84000-87FFF
22 = 88000-8BFFF
23 = 8C000-8FFFF
24 = 90000-93FFF
25 = 94000-97FFF
26 = 98000-9BFFF
27 = 9C000-9FFFF
28 = A0000-A3FFF
29 = A4000-A7FFF
2A = A8000-ABFFF
2B = AC000-AFFFF
2C = B0000-B3FFF
2D = B4000-B7FFF
2E = B8000-BBFFF
2F = BC000-BFFFF
30 = C0000-C3FFF
31 = C4000-C7FFF
32 = C8000-CBFFF
33 = CC000-CFFFF
34 = D0000-D3FFF
35 = D4000-D7FFF
36 = D8000-DBFFF
37 = DC000-DFFFF
38 = E0000-E3FFF
39 = E4000-E7FFF
3A = E8000-EBFFF
3B = EC000-EFFFF
3C = F0000-F3FFF
3D = F4000-F7FFF
3E = F8000-FBFFF
3F = FC000-FFFFF
40 = 100000-13FFFF
…

And so on, I’m sure you can figure it out from here. Ok, now we figured out
that the bank location is 6B. The second part is simply the last byte. Since
where looking to something that points to 1AF239, it will be 39. The third
byte is the middle byte. So the middle byte is F2. This byte MUST BE between
40-7F. So since its F2, we shall add 80 to it, making it 72. Simply, if it’s not
between 40-7F, add or subtract the middle value by 40 or 80 so that it will be
between 40-7F. I don’t know why it’s like this, don’t ask me. So now that we
figured out what all the values are, the pointer must be 6B7972. So search
for it, if you do not find any results, try reading this again. When you find it,
and know WHERE you want to re-point the pointer, type in the correct values.
Since we want to re-point it to 1FF017, change the pointer to 7F5770. Enter
text starting at 1FF017. Try to load up the ROM. Now try to get the text to
start! Whoo hoo, if you followed my directions correctly, it should of worked.
MOST of the time other pointers that point to similar data (Like other text
strings) are right next to each other. But in some cases, you might not find
what you want, because it might be a 2-byte pointer…

2 Bit Pointers:

2 Bit pointers are the same as 3 bit, but the first value is absent. This is
usually used to save memory. This is usually only used for pointer that point
to things that are already in the same bank.

For example:

Text starts at 92832
A pointer for that text might be located at 91104. The pointer’s values might
simply be 7268.

Sometimes the pointers are divided, so the first part might be in a completely
different place in the ROM –cough- Pokemon Red –Cough-. You shouldn’t
bother with pointers that are divided though, it’s too much of a hassle, but I did
it for Pokemon Red anyway.
